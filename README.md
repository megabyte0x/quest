# quest

Quest is a platform which Protocols/DAOs can use to run different long term campaigns as per their strategy and rewards the participants with the TokenBound NFTs

## Description

We have used **[EIP 6551]("https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551")** (Token Bound Account) in our project which let the NFT holders create a accont through thier NFTs and these account will be able to receive any sorts of assets an EOA can receive.

**quest** provides a functionality through which _an NFT can own other NFTs._ This will help the contributors/participants to create history of their particular NFT which will increase it's value.
The NFT holder will be the controller of the account generated by the particular NFT and will be able to make any transaction through it like a normal EOA.

## Example Use Case

THE QUEST by Polygon Advacates is a program where Polygon Advacates have to do complete certain task through which they will be able to earn different NFTs.

### Normal Flow

This flow doesn't help to increase the value of the NFTs through more contribution by the NFT holders.

### Flow with quest platform

This flow helps the NFT holders to increase the value of their NFT by contributing more to the DAO/Protocol and creating a history of their NFT.
